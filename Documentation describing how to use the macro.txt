A SAS® Macro for Calibration of Survey Weights
Tony An, PhD 
SAS Institute Inc.

ABSTRACT
In survey sampling, calibration is commonly used for adjusting weights to ensure that estimates for covariates in the
sample match known auxiliary information, such as marginal totals from census data. Calibration can also be used to
adjust for unit nonresponse. This paper discusses a macro for calibration that was developed using SAS/STAT® 15.1
and SAS/IML® software. The macro enables you to input the design information, the controls for the auxiliary variables,
and your preferred calibration method, including either a linear or exponential method. Because an unbounded
calibration method can result in extreme calibration weights, this macro also supports bounded versions of both linear
and exponential calibration methods. The macro creates calibration replication weights according to the sample
design and the specified calibration method. Examples are given to illustrate how to use the macro.
